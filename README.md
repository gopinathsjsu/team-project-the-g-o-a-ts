# XP Core Values:
1. Simplicity
   
   • The program must be UI-friendly so users can easily use the implemented features.
   
   • We gave a rating of 1-5 to each feature, 1 being the most important one and 5 being the least important one. We only put in the ones equal to or less than 3 into the program so no confusion or misunderstanding will happen.

2. Courage

   • We were willing to communicate in the discord server and point out others' mistakes if necessary.

   • We also had debts on which database to choose from that would best fit with the project. 

   • This is crucial for making knowledgeable decisions that benefit the project in the long run.
